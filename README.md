<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

    RoboStock is a trading app that was created by the developers to practice and learn how to develop web applications using Ruby on Rails. Users can buy and sell stocks that are available on the application by creating a new trader account. They can also manage all existing users by logging into an admin account. RoboStock also has some additional API features such as displaying up to date stock market news, prices and even displaying random jokes.
